## Patent Grant

The licensor grants a patent license covering claims necessary for using the software. This license is automatically terminated if you or your organization assert any patent claim against the licensor or users of the software.

## Noncompete Clause

You shall not use the software or its derivatives to develop, market, or distribute any product that competes with the software or any product offered by the licensor or its affiliates.

Definition of Competition

A product competes with the software if it provides similar functionality, regardless of differences in platform, programming language, or implementation. Examples include applications marketed as replacements or alternatives to the software.

## Changing Market Conditions

If the licensor or its affiliates start selling a product that competes with your use of the software, your right to use the software for that product is limited to versions made available before the licensor entered the market.

## Discontinued Offerings

You may compete with products that the licensor or its affiliates have officially discontinued offering, unless a `Licensor Line of Business` notice explicitly prohibits this. Here's an example:

> Licensor Line of Business: VexorAI Development Tools (https://example.com/vexorai)

## Sublicensing and Assignment
